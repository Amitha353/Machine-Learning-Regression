## Simple Regression
* 1 input and fit a line to data. (intercept and the slope coefficients).

#### Cost of the line
* Residual sum of squares (RSS) - Sum of the square of difference between the original value and the predicted value.
* Use RSS to asses different fits to the model.
* Choose the best fit on the training data that minimizes over the "intercept" and "slope".

### Gradient Descent
* Iterative Algorithm that moves in the direction of the negative gradient.
* for convex functions it converges to the optimum.
